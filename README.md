the ants march along the wall 

to whom it shall concern

<br>
to the enemy of memory-state 

face the wall and your fate

babylon is babbling 

like a sputtering engine

and the whore is a queen of ants

 the long sliver tongue 

 of the south american anteater

 is at the door, knocks upon the gates

the ants eat their own 

the locusts swarm until mutation 

bringing forth a plague of God

for thy dishonesty

<br>

wear your spectacles

proudly

if you know how to keep your pride

from the way of fallen angels
<br>

system delete yourself now

system sing a song

of sirens 

say the thing now 

which rattles the ribcage

and squeezes the ounce of gold

from a jaded soul
<br>

i threw into the water

an old jade stone

green and precious 
<br>
sisyphus fucked himself 

in reverse karma-sutra

lost his mind of syphillis 

and narcissus drowned

in the puddle of his own 

piss-poor devices 
<br>

phillistene and pharasaical 

pharmaceutical mosaics 

of fledgeling vultures

schizoid epistemologies

that require your lobotomy
<br>

boots boots  moving up and down again

the ants march along the wall 
<br>

eat the bugs

they said 

so i helped myself

to a healthy Macca serving
